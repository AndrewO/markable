= Markable

A module for adding Markaby to your classes.

== Usage

Simply include the module into a class and BOOM!  Your classes can output themselves in any format Markaby can generate.  Fun for the whole family.

class Sample
  include Markable
  
  attr_reader :title, :text
  def initialize(title, text)
    @title, @text = title, text
  end
  
  def format
    mab do
      html do
        head do
          title @title
        end
        body do
          p @text
        end
      end
    end
  end
  
end

Or, we can see how easy it is to use methods are partial templates:

class SampleWithHelpers
  include Markable
  
  attr_reader :title, :text
  def initialize(title, text)
    @title, @text = title, text
  end
  
  def format
    mab do
      html do
        head do
          title @title
        end
        body do
          red_paragraph
        end
      end
    end
  end
  
  def red_paragraph
    p :style => "red" do
      @text
    end
  end
end
